Coding Style for Sorry
Dominic Stringer and Connor Rajotte

1.) Spacing for level dictation should be 4 spaces (1 tab)
2.) For conditional statements, both start and end brackets should be on their own line, even if itâ€™s a 1-line statement.
3.) <<, +, -, and = operators should be spaced out
4.) *, /, ^, and (), should not be spaced out
5.) Lists separated by commas or semicolons should be spaced out
6.) Comments should be on the line before and not tabbed
7.) Every file should start with a version modification with a name, a list of contents, a general description
8.) Give one line spacing between segments of code such as functions, class declarations, and #includes/#defines/namespace things
9.) Pass by reference whenever possible
10.) Space out segments of code based on Stage in function
11.) Use camelCase with lowercase start for variable names
12.) Inline functions longer than 1 line should be built just like a regular function
