Game Board

Slides
If a pawn ends at the start of a slide, the pawn skids to the end of that slide
Any pawns in the middle of that slide are sent back to their respective start square
        
Safety Zone
Pawns are safe here because no other player can affect a pawn here
A player can only enter safety zones matching the color of their pawn from where it joins the open track
        
Home
This is the final destination for your pawns. You can only reach here by an exact count
        
Setup

Gameplay
On each turn, player must select one card from their hand
Move one of your pawns according to the card
A new card will be added to your hand
If a pawn ends on a square that is occupied by another pawn, then the occupying pawn is sent back to its start square
To move a pawn from your start out onto the open track, you must draw either a 1 or a 2
If it is a 2, do as it says, then draw again and move if possible
If at any time you cannot move, you forfeit your turn but otherwise you must move
Once a pawn has reached HOME, it cannot not move anymore for the rest of the game
